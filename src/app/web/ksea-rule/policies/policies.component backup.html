          Council prior to the Council meeting. Preliminary candidates shall be

          <li>
            Floor nomination: at least 2/3 of the Councilors attending the

          deviation. For a project that does not follow the original objective
          or does not make satisfactory progress, the President can terminate

            Processing of Petition: The President and the HAC shall very

            immediately verify the qualifications of the petitioners and forward
            it to the HAC and the accused person. The HAC shall carefully
            investigate the petition in the following manner:

            membership of any member or expel any member as described in Article
