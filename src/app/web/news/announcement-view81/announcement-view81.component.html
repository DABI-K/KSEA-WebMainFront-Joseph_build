                YGF and YPF are global leadership events building a global community of domestic and foreign experts 
                around high-tech science and technology, and facilitating the exchange of ideas between them. The 
                Korean Federation also seeks to promote the ethnic bonds between students from ethnic Korean students 
                from across the world.

              <p class="txt-deco-line">Frequently Asked Questions</p>
              <p class="font-bold">Eligibility Questions</p>
              <p>
                Q: I will be graduating/finishing my graduate program this May or June. Am I still eligible?
                <br />
                A: Yes, you are eligible.
              </p>
              <p>
                Q: I am starting a graduate program this fall. Am I still eligible for YPF?
                <br />
                A: No, you are not eligible for YPF. If you are currently enrolled as an undergraduate student, 
                please apply to YGF.
              </p>
              <p>
                Q: Do post-baccalaureate programs count as graduate degrees?
                <br />
                A: No, unfortunately, they do not.
              </p>
              <p>
                Q: I am a young professional (i.e. non-student); can I still apply?
                <br />
                A: Unfortunately, no.
              </p>
              <p>
                Q: I have attended school in the US, but I am not a citizen nor a permanent resident. 
                May I still apply?
                <br />
                A: Unfortunately, no.
              </p>
              <p>
                Q: I am not a US Citizen / Permanent Resident. Can I still apply?
                <br />
                A: KSEA is only in charge of the US applicants. Other countries (e.g. Canada) must apply 
                through their sponsoring organization. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Q: Do I need to be active in KSEA, or a current member?
                <br />
                A: Yes. The only requirement is that you are a paid/registered
                member of KSEA at the time of application.
              </p>
              <p>
                Q: Are there any exceptions to the eligibility requirements?
                <br />
                A: No, unfortunately not.
              </p>
              <p class="font-bol">Application Questions</p>
              <p>
                Q: Is a copy and paste from an unofficial transcript OK for the
                application?
                <br />
                A: Yes, it is. However, all information on your application may
                be subject to verification.
              </p>
              <p>
                Q: What are the criteria for judging applicants?
                <br />
                A: The admissions process is holistic. We are looking for three things: academic achievement, 
                leadership achievement and/or interesting experiences. It isn't necessary to show achievement 
                in all three aspects, but please try to show positive attributes in at least one of these aspects. 
                Also, as this is an intense networking forum, we want to see that you can handle long days that are 
                full of meeting many new and very interesting people, sightseeing, and working on team building 
                exercises. 
              </p>
              <p>
                Q: What should I do if my summer plans are unknown?
                <br />
                A: Unfortunately, you will need to determine your summer plans before applying. We highly discourage 
                people from canceling as KOFST does not wait-list candidates and cancellations reduce the number of 
                spots accepted from the U.S. the following year. On the other hand, you may submit your application, 
                and can let us know by the application deadline if you still would like to attend.
              </p>
              <p>
                Q: Are there any other special considerations?
                <br />
                A: Yes, KOFST encourages socially disadvantaged students to apply, such as being an adoptee, 
                an orphan, from a single parent family, etc. There is a place in the application to indicate this.
              </p>
              <p>
                Q: What does it mean to be a finalist versus getting the final
                notification from KOFST?
                <br />
                A: Finalist means that you were nominated by KSEA to attend, and are likely to attend. However, 
                final acceptance is pending review by the KOFST, usually by the end of April. 
              </p>
              <p class="font-bold">Program Questions</p>
              <p>
                Q: Is the trip really covered?!
                <br />
                A: Yes, food and lodging is fully covered by KOFST at no expense to you. You will have to purchase 
                your own flight tickets and will be reimbursed after the conference, up to $1,570 (West Coast), 
                $2,070 (Middle), and $2,144 (East Coast), for a round-trip. Your location (west, middle, or east) 
                is determined by the address listed on your application. You will need to provide a copy of your 
                flight receipt and boarding pass to KSEA after YGF/YPF to verify your flights.
              </p>
              <p>
                Q: What if my round-trip flight costs more than the allocated
                amount?
                <br />
                A: Unfortunately, summertime flights to Korea are expensive and the reimbursement amount might not 
                cover the entire amount. Attendees are expected to cover the difference, but we hope that the free 
                lodging, free meals, and the flight reimbursement (plus the experience!) offset any major financial 
                burden.

                Q: Can I arrive earlier or leave later than the YPF program dates?
                <br />
                A: Yes, we encouraged participants to arrive early or stay later for further sightseeing, 
                family visits, or post-forum meet-ups with your new YGF/YPF friends depending on your schedule. 
                You may purchase your airplane ticket to accommodate this extended schedule. However rooming and 
                meals outside of the YGF/YPF program will be on your own. You may coordinate with your fellow US 
                attendees via Facebook group or email once accepted.

                Q: What is the purpose of this trip?
                <br />
                A: The goal of this program is to increase collaboration and create networks between promising 
                young students with Korean heritage from around the world. The idea is to start an intellectual / 
                cultural exchange, and to help promote ties between ethnic-Koreans around the world as the future 
                global leaders.
