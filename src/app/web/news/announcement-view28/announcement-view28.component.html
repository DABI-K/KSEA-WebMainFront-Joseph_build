              <p>Dear KSEA Members, families and friends,</p>
              <p>
                I am writing to invite you to the online event at 7pm ET on
                Saturday, March 4th to celebrate the life and career of KSEA
                30th President Nak Ho Sung who passed away in October 22, 2022
                in Korea.
              </p>
              <p>
                The KSEA community would like to extend our deepest condolences
                to Prof. Sungâ€™s family one more time.
              </p>
              <p>
                Professor Sung was Professor of Chemical and Biological
                Engineering at Tufts University, was the Director and Founder of
                the Laboratory for Materials and Interfaces, and chaired the
                department of Chemical and Biological Engineering. Prior to
                joining Tufts University in 1978, he was a Research Associate

                in Polymer Science and Engineering, focused on structural
                composites and multiphase systems. He was an elected member of
                National Academy of Engineering of Korea.
              </p>

                The 30th President of the KSEA Prof. Sung had served on many
