              <p>Dear members of KSEA:</p>
              <p>
                It is with great pride and honor that I send this greeting to
                you as the newly inaugurated President of the KSEA. I extend my
                heartfelt gratitude to each and every one of you for entrusting
                me with this esteemed position, and to my utmost capacity, I am
                committed to serving the KSEA and its noble mission to advance
                scientific excellence and technological innovation.
              </p>
              <p>
                I would like to take a moment to reflect on the remarkable
                journey that has led KSEA to this point. KSEA for the past 51
                years has been a source of immense talent, ingenuity, and
                resilience. Our members have made significant contributions to
                various fields of science and engineering, leaving an indelible
                mark through their groundbreaking discoveries, inventions and
                entrepreneurship. The outstanding contributions of KSEA members
                were vividly showcased at the 1st World Congress of Korean
                Scientists and Engineers, held in Seoul, Korea from July 4th to
                July 7th, 2023.
              </p>
              <p>
                As the president of KSEA, I had the honor of receiving honors on
                behalf of our organization (you can watch the video of the event
                here:
                <a

                  >https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8vtYGVdmziQ)</a
                >. However, this humbling experience has deeply reminded and
                moved me, underscoring the significant role played by those, who
                came before me, through their unwavering passion, elevated our
                organization to such esteemed heights.
              </p>
              <p>
                Today, we find ourselves in an era of unprecedented
                opportunities and challenges. We face complex issues that demand
                our collective expertise, dedication, and collaboration. As the
                President of KSEA, I pledge to foster an inclusive and
                empowering environment where our members can leverage their
                diverse perspectives and experiences to address these challenges
                head-on.
              </p>
              <p>
                KSEA will continue to excel as a catalyst for fostering
                meaningful network and collaborations for scientists and
                engineers in the US and Korea. KSEA will continue to be the
                platform for knowledge-sharing, mentorship, and professional
                development, empowering the next generation of innovators to
                realize their full potential. By cultivating a vibrant network
                of support, we can inspire one another, nurture our talents, and
                create a lasting impact for our world.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am deeply committed to strengthening partnerships and
                collaborations with Korean organizations, institutions, and
                industry leaders. By forging strategic alliances, we can amplify
                our collective voice, advocate for policies that promote
                scientific advancement, and create opportunities for
                cross-disciplinary collaboration that drive transformative
                impacts.
              </p>
              <p>
                I am truly humbled to lead such an exceptional association of
                brilliant minds, dedicated professionals, and passionate
                volunteers. Together, let us build upon the strong foundation
                laid by our predecessors and strive for even greater heights. By
                embracing diversity, fostering innovation, and nurturing the
                spirit of exploration, KSEA will advance the frontiers of
                science and engineering, and inspire future generations to dream
                big and change the world.
              </p>
              <p>
                Thank you for your unwavering support, and I look forward to a
                productive and impactful tenure as the President of KSEA.
              </p>
