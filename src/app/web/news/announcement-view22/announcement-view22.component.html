              <p>
                We are delighted to announce that the 36th annual US-Korea
                Conference (UKC 2023) will take place from August 2 to 5, 2023,
                at the Hyatt Regency DFW (Dallas-Fort Worth), Texas, USA. The
                conference is jointly organized by the Korean-American
                Scientists and Engineers Association (KSEA), the Korean
                Federation of Science and Technology Societies (KOFST), and the
                Korea-U.S. Science Cooperation Center (KUSCO).

              <p>
                This year's conference theme is "Discovery, Innovation, and
                Dissemination for Transformative Impact", and it aims to offer
                unique opportunities for participants to actively engage in
                various symposiums and forums, focused on the transformative
                impact of science, technology, and entrepreneurship on our daily
                lives, which have been significantly challenged and altered by
                the pandemic.
              </p>
              <p>
                UKC 2023 will bring together over 1,000 scientists, engineers,
                entrepreneurs, government officials, corporate executives, and
                policy-makers, providing a platform for sharing ideas,
                experiences, and expertise. We are confident that the conference
                will be a productive and engaging event, and we encourage you to
                submit your papers and participate in this exciting opportunity.
