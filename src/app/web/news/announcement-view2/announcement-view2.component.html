              <p>
                Happy holidays!!<br />

                I am writing to invite you to the 3rd KSEA Distinguished Guest
                Series on Wednesday, January 11, 2023 with John S. Kim, the
                Co-Founder and CEO of SendBird and the recipient of the 2022
                KSEA Entrepreneurship of the Year Award.

                SendBird is the no. 1 conversations platform for mobile apps,
                serving over 300M monthly chat users across the world’s leading
                companies such as DoorDash, Reddit, Yahoo!, Rakuten, Paytm, and
                Walgreens. Under John’s leadership, SendBird has raised $220M+
                and officially became a unicorn in 2021. In this session, John
                Kim will speak about his journey to becoming CEO of SendBird. He
                will participate in a question-and-answer session following his
